# mummyd | Simple HTTP dev server using Mummy
Simple http server for usage in local development.  
Made with Nim and Mummy.  
Goal: Simple setup for quick prototyping of static websites.  

## Status
_(work in progress)_  
Does its job, but some things are currently a bit clunky.  
Goal is to achieve automatic reloading functionality in the style of Vite and the VSCode extensions `live-server` and `live-five-server`.
